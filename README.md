--> these papers and repos do not report clearly about the speed improvement
Only focus on accuracy and compress-ratio (model size)

--> Official Pytorch supports Quantization - but only an experimental version
--> the quantized model can not run on Mobile
https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/1943




Tensorflow lite 
https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/hosted_models

--> Show clearly model-size and speed and also give pretrained and quantized model 



My opinion: 

- If we want to get the mobile-ready model, I will focus on tensorflow lite first, learn how to build model on TF, learn to convert model to Tf-lite, and convert quantized model 

- If we want to explore compression-idea, only focus on compress-ratio vs accuracy tradeoff, and do not care much about mobile-ready model and speed, I will focus on pytorch repo, try to reproduct paper reports.
